# React project

Introductory project to React where we have created and implemented 4 components to the home view of a takeaway restaurant. The four components are: Header, FoodSection, Counter and Card.

The FoodSection component is made up of cards, which in turn have a counter implemented in order to be able to add them to the order. All these components receive information through the props established for each of them.
